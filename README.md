# Geo11_Mod_Manager 

This project is on pause while I work on a Steam library importer and just all around migration to coding python. This project was my first that really let me quit sales and move on to full time developement. I'll update with a python release under a system framework, until then, if it ain't got issues don't break it. Thanks everyone. 

Update -  works with Katanga launcher. https://streamable.com/kov060

This is designed as support for 3dfix, right now geo11 requires manual loading and unloading for 2d games. I saw an opportunity to help the community in a small way, and maybe bolster the geo11 team's efforts on their great release.

I am not affiliated with the Geo11 team, just a fan.

This app will take the Geo11 files such as dxd11.dll and move to a "geo" folder in the game's directory. It will also launch HelixVision/Kananga/VirtualDesktop as an option. 

It creates a desktop shortcut, when clicked, it will move the game's original "dxd11.dll" files to "/originaldx" and load geo11 dxd11 files. . Creating a VR specific launcher/shortcut.
