Geo11_Shortcut_Maker - this is designed as support for 3dfix, right now geo11 requires manual loading and unloading for 2d games.  I saw an opportunity to help the community in a small way, and maybe bolster the geo11 team's efforts on this great release. 

I am not affiliated with the Geo11 team, just a fan. 

This app will take the Geo11 files such as dxd11.dll and move to a "geo" folder in the game's directory. 
It creates a desktop shortcut, when clicked, it will move the game's original "dxd11.dll" files to "/originaldx" and 
load geo11 dxd11 files. Creating a VR specific launcher/shortcut.

On game close, the files will return to original locations.
