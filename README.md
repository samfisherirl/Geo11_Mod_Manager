This is designed as support for 3dfix, right now geo11 requires manual loading and unloading for 2d games. I saw an opportunity to help the community in a small way, and maybe bolster the geo11 team's efforts on their great release.

I am not affiliated with the Geo11 team, just a fan.

This app will take the Geo11 files such as dxd11.dll and move to a "geo" folder in the game's directory. It will also launch HelixVision/Kananga/VirtualDesktop as an option. 

It creates a desktop shortcut, when clicked, it will move the game's original "dxd11.dll" files to "/originaldx" and load geo11 dxd11 files. . Creating a VR specific launcher/shortcut.
