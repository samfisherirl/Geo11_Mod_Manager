This app will take the Geo11 files such as dxd11.dll and move to a /geo/ folder
It creates a desktop shortcut, when clicked, it will move the game's original "dxd11.dll" files to /orig/ loading Geo11 files.
Creating a VR specific launcher/shortcut. On game close, the files will return to original locations.
